sublimetext-aspjs
=================

ASP JScript syntax definitions for Sublime Text 2.

These syntax definitions are modifications of the default VB flavoured syntax definitions
supplied in the 'ASP' package. These syntax definitions 'include' source.js to provide
the JScript syntax definitions, and retain the ASP object definitions provided in the default
definitions.

Installation
------------

Hide the existing ASP package - add the following to user settings:

        "ignored_packages":
        [
            "ASP"
        ],

Copy the two new syntax definitions to Packages/ASPJS.
